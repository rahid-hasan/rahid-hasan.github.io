<p>In the last year Mozilla Bangladesh first time arranged <a href="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/moziftar-mozilla-bangladesh-iftar-party-2012/" target="_blank">MozIftar in Dhaka</a>. It was an interesting event. Iftar basically an Islamic term. In the holy month of Ramadan muslim people fasting the whole day &amp; take meal at the dawn. It is called Iftar. We mozillians from Bangladesh do that thing together with Mozilla mission. And named it MozIftar. From last year we are regularly arranging MozIftar in Bangladesh. This event taken place in Star Kabab (Old Dhaka) on July 29, 2013.</p>
<p>We had some agendas for this meetup:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set a plan &amp; direction for Mozilla Bangladesh for next one year.</li>
<li>Build a event calendar.</li>
<li>If possible create some program specific task force.</li>
<li>Discuss about event plan (cost &#8211; benefit &amp; event target).</li>
<li>We have some issues to discuss face to face.</li>
<li>And ofcourse Iftar :-)</li>
</ul>
<div style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="MozIftar Dhaka 2013 Banner" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3712/9638279738_3702b91b5e.jpg" width="500" height="281" /><p class="wp-caption-text">MozIftar Dhaka 2013 Banner</p></div>
<p><span id="more-42"></span>We opened a sign-up form for this event. We found around 70 people signed up for the event. We expected there will be around 50 people in the event. But beyond all expectation we found 70+!! We never thought it can be happen. In the last year MozIftar Dhaka attended by only 10/12 Mozillians. Surely we reached a great momentum since then. Most Importantly this year we had arranged another <a href="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/moziftar-chittagong-2013/" target="_blank">MozIftar in Chittagong</a>. It was attended by around 40 Mozillians.</p>
<div style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="MozIftar Dhaka 2013" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7394/9638284400_24d99283f0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" /><p class="wp-caption-text">MozIftar Dhaka 2013</p></div>
<p>In the event our senior Mozillian Mahay Alam Khan started the discussion. He emphasized on using mailing list for formal discussion. We discussed about our future goal of Mozilla Bangladesh, the upcoming Mozilla Summit 2013, future event plan &amp; most importantly we decided to propose to set Cox&#8217;s Bazar as a venue of South Asian Meet-up in 2014.</p>
<div style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="MozIftar Dhaka 2013 Group Photo" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7409/10979091765_a13e0c723c.jpg" width="500" height="375" /><p class="wp-caption-text">MozIftar Dhaka 2013 Group Photo</p></div>
<p>We also found a lot new enthusiast who&#8217;s are interested to contribute in Mozilla. They was pretty curious about the activity of Mozilla Bangladesh. And I found some really interested people from BRAC University. They are interested for a FxOS event in their campus. We had a successful discussion about that.</p>
<p>It was the last event for the MozIftar Bangladesh 2013. We had plan for another MozIftar this year in Cox&#8217;s Bazar. But for some unavoidable reason we had to drop Cox&#8217;s Bazar as a venue of MozIftar Bangladesh 2013.</p>

<p>Since the last year we Mozilla Bangladesh start an interesting event idea. MozIftar! Iftar is a religious term for muslim peoples. In the holy month of Ramadan muslims fasting the whole day till the dawn. At the evening they take their meal. Its called Iftar. Now in muslim world Iftar Party is very much popular. Here we do the same thing with Mozilla mission. Its much like a meetup with Islamic ethics.</p>
<div style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="MozIftar Chittagong 2013" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7323/9638043014_c815525f84_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" /><p class="wp-caption-text">MozIftar Chittagong 2013</p></div>
<p><span id="more-37"></span>Last year we did the MozIftar in Dhaka only. But this year we have broaden our capability to Chittagong also. The MozIftar Chittagong arranged on July 12, 2013. It was taken place in MFC, Chittagong. Around forty people joined the event.</p>
<p>It was basically a meet-up with Chittagong Mozillians. We discussed about different plans &amp; upcoming event ideas. Their was proposal for Firefox OS App Training Day in International Islamic University &amp; East Delta University. Also we discussed about future of Mozilla Chittagong Community &amp; how we can relate with different Mozilla programs.</p>
<div style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="Mozillians waiting for Iftar time" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5471/9638032746_6b8596099e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Mozillians waiting for Iftar time</p></div>
<p>As already told their was about 40 Mozillians attended. I can remember only few names. Among them Towfique Anam Rine worked really hard to make it happen. Also their was Shamsuzzaman Sadi, Rakib, Asif, Iftekhar, Rashed, Arnob, Rafa &amp; more others Mozillians cooperated &amp; attended the event. Robin Mehedee &amp; me traveled from Dhaka to join this event.</p>
<div style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="Dinner!" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7439/9634799997_cab1be1d84_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Dinner!</p></div>
<p>Thanks to all awesome Chittagong Mozillian to make another successful event.</p>
