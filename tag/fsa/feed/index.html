<p>Firefox Student Ambassadors program just launched recently. With less than a month we successfully organized an event. The very first Student Ambassador event. It was a meetup of Firefox Student Ambassadors &amp; Mozillians of Mozilla Bangladesh Community.<span id="more-14"></span></p>
<div style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="Team AUB Firefox Club" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3675/8988291308_d5a545e015_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Team AUB Firefox Club</p></div>
<p>This event organized by AUB Firefox Club with the support of Mozilla Bangladesh. The club lead Zobayer Ahmed Khan take the initiative &amp; play a really crucial role to make it happen.</p>
<p>The background of this event is very interesting. On June 2, 2013 in a FB chat Zobayer asked me to meet with the club members of AUB Firefox Club and give them some direction. I asked him why not do something big &amp; more open? I proposed him to organize a Meetup event for all Firefox Student Ambassadors in Dhaka. He take that challenge &amp; make it happen to oraganize the first Firefox Student Ambassadors Meetup in just 4 days! This is really awesome \m/ . Feels like a Mozillians!!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8123/8988262540_711788a7e1_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p>Primarily we estimate a rough plan of the event. As he is not a Rep, I created the event on Reps portal &amp; asked for the budget. Before that I discuss with my mentor Vineel. He gave me a very positive response. And just the day before the event Soumya Deb gave me the green signal on behalf of the Reps Council that the budget is approved.</p>
<p>My estimation was there will be 25 to 30 attendee. Among them 15 to 20 Student Ambassadors, 5 to 10 Mozillians, 5 to 7 WoMoz &amp; atleast 2 Mozilla Reps will join in this event. But there was also a little bit bad weather on event day. That can hamper those figures. And I&#8217;m shocked to see the awesomeness of Mozillians participation!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Open discussion session" alt="Open discussion session" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7414/8987075045_f621ae4834_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p>I found 35 attendee in the event. Among them 15 Student Ambassador, 5 WoMoz, 18 Mozillian &amp; 2 Mozilla Rep attended. Really unexpected from me. I never thought this crowd. Interestingly two WoMoz (Asma &amp; Mukta) came after about 1.5 hours of journey! What a passion!!</p>
<p>We started our event on 4:30 PM at Uttara Amontron Restaurant. Me (Rahid Hasan) started with a little introduction. I introduce the AUB Firefox Club &amp; its lead Zobayer Ahmed to the audience. Whose are the big guy of this arrangement. Later everyone introduce their name and their University/Institute. Most of the mozillians came from Dhaka Polytechnic Institute. Their was also Mozillians from North South University, American International University &#8211; Bangladesh, International University of Business Agriculture &amp; Technology. And ofcourse the organizing team from Asian University of Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Then Ashickur Rahman (Mozilla Reps) start the interactive session. We asked them some questions. They response &amp; share their ideas. The gist of that session is here:</p>
