				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>What was the greatest moment of Mozilla Bangladesh?</strong> If you ask this question before 22nd February I must be puzzled! Their was a few great things we passed in last few years. Especially the Mozilla Summit was too awesome. Also the last year was full of some great events. Its quite tough to find the best moment. But now if you ask me the same question I have no doubt to select that. Yesterday on February 22nd we arranged the very first meetup of our newly formed community task forces. This is the best thing ever happened for our awesome community.</p>
<div id="attachment_62" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1.jpg"><img src="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1.jpg" alt="Mozilla Bangladesh Task Force Group Photo" width="800" height="534" class="size-full wp-image-62" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mozilla Bangladesh Task Force Group Photo</p></div>
<p><span id="more-56"></span></p>
<p>So what was that actually? Not too far from today, one year earlier our community was quite small with limited number of contributors. But within these time we have had a boost of 10x!! Which was quite unexpected. The main reason of that boost is FSA program &amp; Chittagong tour in the mid of last year. To make our community more awesome &amp; dedicated in the end of last year we planned to initiate some community task forces. Which was introduced last month. The details of the task force can be found <a href="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/introducing-task-force-of-mozilla-bangladesh" title="Introducing Mozilla Bangladesh Task Force" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>After the task force formed our community lead Mahay Alam Khan take the initiative to meet all task force members for discussion &amp; plan for 2014. He did a tremendous job to make this happen just within few weeks. Kudos to him &amp; also Ashickur Rahman to make it possible.</p>
<div id="attachment_64" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/3.jpg"><img src="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/3.jpg" alt="Mozilla Bangladesh Task Force Meetup" width="800" height="600" class="size-full wp-image-64" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mozilla Bangladesh Task Force Meetup</p></div>
<p>The meetup taken place in the conference room of Hotel 71 Dhaka. All the Task Force leads, peers &amp; members was invited. Also we invited 8 more mozillians to join us. For exam &amp; other reasons 3 task force members &amp; 1 mozilian was unable to join us. All the task force leads &amp; Reps (Mahay Alam Khan, Mashkawat Ahsan, Belayet Hossain, Ashickur Rahman, Shafiul Azam, Aniruddha Adhikay, Ratul Minhaz, Tanha Islam &amp; Rahid Hasan) was attended. Some folks came to Dhaka after traveling the whole night.</p>
<p>Mahay Alam Khan welcome everybody to join this meetup. Everybody introduced them with their unique gesture. Following that Mahay Alam Khan lead the session “Overview 2014 and Goals from Mozilla”. He recently attended Mozilla San Fransisco work week in January. Aniruddha Adhikary &amp; other folks actively discussed &amp; shared their views regarding this. Just after that each task force started their SWOT analysis. The SWOT analysis of Marketing lead by Mashkawat Ahsan was really eye catchy. Maliha Mamtaz assisted to put all inputs from different task force in a single <a href="https://bangladesh.etherpad.mozilla.org/94" title="SWOT Analysis | Mozilla Bangladesh Task Force Meetup" target="_blank">etherpad</a>. Next we started discussion on these SWOT analysis of different task forces. This session was moderated by Rahid Hasan. A member from each task force presented their SWOT analysis and we shared our views &amp; discussed on it. The SWOT of Community Engagement task force was most important. The most discussed item was “Lone wolf in the community”. It was taken most of the time of the whole session. Recently we have faced some discrete &amp; meaningless activities in different areas. Which harmed our community cohesion. These kind of activities was discussed with highest priority.</p>
<div id="attachment_63" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.jpg"><img src="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.jpg" alt="SWOT Analysis" width="800" height="534" class="size-full wp-image-63" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">SWOT Analysis</p></div>
<p>After SWOT discussion we have joined in the lunch. That was too good. Ashickur Rahman, Belayet Hosssain, Maliha Momtaz &amp; some other folks took the lead &amp; show us how to eat! Following the lunch we did some group photos on the venue roof top.</p>
<p>The second half was started with presentation “Million Mozillians” by Mahay Alam Khan. It was a pretty interactive session. He discussed what is mozillian &amp; why we need millions of mozillians. Following this we started to build the event calendar for 2014. Mahay Alam Khan was the lead of this session. The draft sketch can be found <a href="https://bangladesh.etherpad.mozilla.org/96" title="Draft Event Proposal Mozilla Bangladesh 2014" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>We had a small experience sharing session at last. This session was mainly for those whose are new or low profiled but did some great things from their places. Forhad, Istiaque, Rabby, Fahia &amp; Sumi expressed their views, success stories &amp; experience with us.</p>
<div id="attachment_65" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/4.jpg"><img src="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/4.jpg" alt="Mozilla Bangladesh Reps" width="800" height="296" class="size-full wp-image-65" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mozilla Bangladesh Reps</p></div>
<p>Meetup was ended up with yet another photo session with different task forces &amp; all Mozilla Bangladesh Reps.</p>
