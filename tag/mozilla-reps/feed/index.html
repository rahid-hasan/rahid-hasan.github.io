				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>What was the greatest moment of Mozilla Bangladesh?</strong> If you ask this question before 22nd February I must be puzzled! Their was a few great things we passed in last few years. Especially the Mozilla Summit was too awesome. Also the last year was full of some great events. Its quite tough to find the best moment. But now if you ask me the same question I have no doubt to select that. Yesterday on February 22nd we arranged the very first meetup of our newly formed community task forces. This is the best thing ever happened for our awesome community.</p>
<div id="attachment_62" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1.jpg"><img src="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1.jpg" alt="Mozilla Bangladesh Task Force Group Photo" width="800" height="534" class="size-full wp-image-62" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mozilla Bangladesh Task Force Group Photo</p></div>
<p><span id="more-56"></span></p>
<p>So what was that actually? Not too far from today, one year earlier our community was quite small with limited number of contributors. But within these time we have had a boost of 10x!! Which was quite unexpected. The main reason of that boost is FSA program &amp; Chittagong tour in the mid of last year. To make our community more awesome &amp; dedicated in the end of last year we planned to initiate some community task forces. Which was introduced last month. The details of the task force can be found <a href="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/introducing-task-force-of-mozilla-bangladesh" title="Introducing Mozilla Bangladesh Task Force" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>After the task force formed our community lead Mahay Alam Khan take the initiative to meet all task force members for discussion &amp; plan for 2014. He did a tremendous job to make this happen just within few weeks. Kudos to him &amp; also Ashickur Rahman to make it possible.</p>
<div id="attachment_64" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/3.jpg"><img src="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/3.jpg" alt="Mozilla Bangladesh Task Force Meetup" width="800" height="600" class="size-full wp-image-64" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mozilla Bangladesh Task Force Meetup</p></div>
<p>The meetup taken place in the conference room of Hotel 71 Dhaka. All the Task Force leads, peers &amp; members was invited. Also we invited 8 more mozillians to join us. For exam &amp; other reasons 3 task force members &amp; 1 mozilian was unable to join us. All the task force leads &amp; Reps (Mahay Alam Khan, Mashkawat Ahsan, Belayet Hossain, Ashickur Rahman, Shafiul Azam, Aniruddha Adhikay, Ratul Minhaz, Tanha Islam &amp; Rahid Hasan) was attended. Some folks came to Dhaka after traveling the whole night.</p>
<p>Mahay Alam Khan welcome everybody to join this meetup. Everybody introduced them with their unique gesture. Following that Mahay Alam Khan lead the session “Overview 2014 and Goals from Mozilla”. He recently attended Mozilla San Fransisco work week in January. Aniruddha Adhikary &amp; other folks actively discussed &amp; shared their views regarding this. Just after that each task force started their SWOT analysis. The SWOT analysis of Marketing lead by Mashkawat Ahsan was really eye catchy. Maliha Mamtaz assisted to put all inputs from different task force in a single <a href="https://bangladesh.etherpad.mozilla.org/94" title="SWOT Analysis | Mozilla Bangladesh Task Force Meetup" target="_blank">etherpad</a>. Next we started discussion on these SWOT analysis of different task forces. This session was moderated by Rahid Hasan. A member from each task force presented their SWOT analysis and we shared our views &amp; discussed on it. The SWOT of Community Engagement task force was most important. The most discussed item was “Lone wolf in the community”. It was taken most of the time of the whole session. Recently we have faced some discrete &amp; meaningless activities in different areas. Which harmed our community cohesion. These kind of activities was discussed with highest priority.</p>
<div id="attachment_63" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.jpg"><img src="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.jpg" alt="SWOT Analysis" width="800" height="534" class="size-full wp-image-63" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">SWOT Analysis</p></div>
<p>After SWOT discussion we have joined in the lunch. That was too good. Ashickur Rahman, Belayet Hosssain, Maliha Momtaz &amp; some other folks took the lead &amp; show us how to eat! Following the lunch we did some group photos on the venue roof top.</p>
<p>The second half was started with presentation “Million Mozillians” by Mahay Alam Khan. It was a pretty interactive session. He discussed what is mozillian &amp; why we need millions of mozillians. Following this we started to build the event calendar for 2014. Mahay Alam Khan was the lead of this session. The draft sketch can be found <a href="https://bangladesh.etherpad.mozilla.org/96" title="Draft Event Proposal Mozilla Bangladesh 2014" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>We had a small experience sharing session at last. This session was mainly for those whose are new or low profiled but did some great things from their places. Forhad, Istiaque, Rabby, Fahia &amp; Sumi expressed their views, success stories &amp; experience with us.</p>
<div id="attachment_65" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/4.jpg"><img src="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/4.jpg" alt="Mozilla Bangladesh Reps" width="800" height="296" class="size-full wp-image-65" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mozilla Bangladesh Reps</p></div>
<p>Meetup was ended up with yet another photo session with different task forces &amp; all Mozilla Bangladesh Reps.</p>

<p>In the last year Mozilla Bangladesh first time arranged <a href="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/moziftar-mozilla-bangladesh-iftar-party-2012/" target="_blank">MozIftar in Dhaka</a>. It was an interesting event. Iftar basically an Islamic term. In the holy month of Ramadan muslim people fasting the whole day &amp; take meal at the dawn. It is called Iftar. We mozillians from Bangladesh do that thing together with Mozilla mission. And named it MozIftar. From last year we are regularly arranging MozIftar in Bangladesh. This event taken place in Star Kabab (Old Dhaka) on July 29, 2013.</p>
<p>We had some agendas for this meetup:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set a plan &amp; direction for Mozilla Bangladesh for next one year.</li>
<li>Build a event calendar.</li>
<li>If possible create some program specific task force.</li>
<li>Discuss about event plan (cost &#8211; benefit &amp; event target).</li>
<li>We have some issues to discuss face to face.</li>
<li>And ofcourse Iftar :-)</li>
</ul>
<div style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="MozIftar Dhaka 2013 Banner" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3712/9638279738_3702b91b5e.jpg" width="500" height="281" /><p class="wp-caption-text">MozIftar Dhaka 2013 Banner</p></div>
<p><span id="more-42"></span>We opened a sign-up form for this event. We found around 70 people signed up for the event. We expected there will be around 50 people in the event. But beyond all expectation we found 70+!! We never thought it can be happen. In the last year MozIftar Dhaka attended by only 10/12 Mozillians. Surely we reached a great momentum since then. Most Importantly this year we had arranged another <a href="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/moziftar-chittagong-2013/" target="_blank">MozIftar in Chittagong</a>. It was attended by around 40 Mozillians.</p>
<div style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="MozIftar Dhaka 2013" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7394/9638284400_24d99283f0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" /><p class="wp-caption-text">MozIftar Dhaka 2013</p></div>
<p>In the event our senior Mozillian Mahay Alam Khan started the discussion. He emphasized on using mailing list for formal discussion. We discussed about our future goal of Mozilla Bangladesh, the upcoming Mozilla Summit 2013, future event plan &amp; most importantly we decided to propose to set Cox&#8217;s Bazar as a venue of South Asian Meet-up in 2014.</p>
<div style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="MozIftar Dhaka 2013 Group Photo" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7409/10979091765_a13e0c723c.jpg" width="500" height="375" /><p class="wp-caption-text">MozIftar Dhaka 2013 Group Photo</p></div>
<p>We also found a lot new enthusiast who&#8217;s are interested to contribute in Mozilla. They was pretty curious about the activity of Mozilla Bangladesh. And I found some really interested people from BRAC University. They are interested for a FxOS event in their campus. We had a successful discussion about that.</p>
<p>It was the last event for the MozIftar Bangladesh 2013. We had plan for another MozIftar this year in Cox&#8217;s Bazar. But for some unavoidable reason we had to drop Cox&#8217;s Bazar as a venue of MozIftar Bangladesh 2013.</p>

<p>Since the last year we Mozilla Bangladesh start an interesting event idea. MozIftar! Iftar is a religious term for muslim peoples. In the holy month of Ramadan muslims fasting the whole day till the dawn. At the evening they take their meal. Its called Iftar. Now in muslim world Iftar Party is very much popular. Here we do the same thing with Mozilla mission. Its much like a meetup with Islamic ethics.</p>
<div style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="MozIftar Chittagong 2013" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7323/9638043014_c815525f84_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" /><p class="wp-caption-text">MozIftar Chittagong 2013</p></div>
<p><span id="more-37"></span>Last year we did the MozIftar in Dhaka only. But this year we have broaden our capability to Chittagong also. The MozIftar Chittagong arranged on July 12, 2013. It was taken place in MFC, Chittagong. Around forty people joined the event.</p>
<p>It was basically a meet-up with Chittagong Mozillians. We discussed about different plans &amp; upcoming event ideas. Their was proposal for Firefox OS App Training Day in International Islamic University &amp; East Delta University. Also we discussed about future of Mozilla Chittagong Community &amp; how we can relate with different Mozilla programs.</p>
<div style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="Mozillians waiting for Iftar time" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5471/9638032746_6b8596099e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Mozillians waiting for Iftar time</p></div>
<p>As already told their was about 40 Mozillians attended. I can remember only few names. Among them Towfique Anam Rine worked really hard to make it happen. Also their was Shamsuzzaman Sadi, Rakib, Asif, Iftekhar, Rashed, Arnob, Rafa &amp; more others Mozillians cooperated &amp; attended the event. Robin Mehedee &amp; me traveled from Dhaka to join this event.</p>
<div style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="Dinner!" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7439/9634799997_cab1be1d84_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Dinner!</p></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="The banner of Firefox Student Ambassadors Meetup" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2864/8970373276_654f4e0832_z.jpg" width="640" height="229" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The banner of Firefox Student Ambassadors Meetup</p></div>
<p>Firefox Student Ambassadors program just launched recently. With less than a month we successfully organized an event. The very first Student Ambassador event. It was a meetup of Firefox Student Ambassadors &amp; Mozillians of Mozilla Bangladesh Community.<span id="more-14"></span></p>
<div style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="Team AUB Firefox Club" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3675/8988291308_d5a545e015_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Team AUB Firefox Club</p></div>
<p>This event organized by AUB Firefox Club with the support of Mozilla Bangladesh. The club lead Zobayer Ahmed Khan take the initiative &amp; play a really crucial role to make it happen.</p>
<p>The background of this event is very interesting. On June 2, 2013 in a FB chat Zobayer asked me to meet with the club members of AUB Firefox Club and give them some direction. I asked him why not do something big &amp; more open? I proposed him to organize a Meetup event for all Firefox Student Ambassadors in Dhaka. He take that challenge &amp; make it happen to oraganize the first Firefox Student Ambassadors Meetup in just 4 days! This is really awesome \m/ . Feels like a Mozillians!!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8123/8988262540_711788a7e1_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p>Primarily we estimate a rough plan of the event. As he is not a Rep, I created the event on Reps portal &amp; asked for the budget. Before that I discuss with my mentor Vineel. He gave me a very positive response. And just the day before the event Soumya Deb gave me the green signal on behalf of the Reps Council that the budget is approved.</p>
<p>My estimation was there will be 25 to 30 attendee. Among them 15 to 20 Student Ambassadors, 5 to 10 Mozillians, 5 to 7 WoMoz &amp; atleast 2 Mozilla Reps will join in this event. But there was also a little bit bad weather on event day. That can hamper those figures. And I&#8217;m shocked to see the awesomeness of Mozillians participation!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Open discussion session" alt="Open discussion session" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7414/8987075045_f621ae4834_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p>I found 35 attendee in the event. Among them 15 Student Ambassador, 5 WoMoz, 18 Mozillian &amp; 2 Mozilla Rep attended. Really unexpected from me. I never thought this crowd. Interestingly two WoMoz (Asma &amp; Mukta) came after about 1.5 hours of journey! What a passion!!</p>
<p>We started our event on 4:30 PM at Uttara Amontron Restaurant. Me (Rahid Hasan) started with a little introduction. I introduce the AUB Firefox Club &amp; its lead Zobayer Ahmed to the audience. Whose are the big guy of this arrangement. Later everyone introduce their name and their University/Institute. Most of the mozillians came from Dhaka Polytechnic Institute. Their was also Mozillians from North South University, American International University &#8211; Bangladesh, International University of Business Agriculture &amp; Technology. And ofcourse the organizing team from Asian University of Bangladesh.</p>
<div style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="Firefox OS Developer Preview Keon demonstration" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7377/8987095957_5d61a75f2a_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Firefox OS Developer Preview Keon demonstration</p></div>
<p>Then Ashickur Rahman (Mozilla Reps) start the interactive session. We asked them some questions. They response &amp; share their ideas. The gist of that session is here:</p>
<p>Why you joined Fx Student Ambassadors?</p>
<div id="magicdomid42">

<li>Open a official club on institute</li>
</ul>
<p>What Kind of Support they might need from Mozilla Bangladesh?</p>
</div>
<div id="magicdomid61">
<ul>
<li>Talk with institute authority to organize events if needed</li>
<li>logistics support like : budget, swag</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="magicdomid63">Question from mozillians</div>
<div id="magicdomid64">
<ul>

</ul>
<div style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2837/8987095739_49dc33f778_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Yammy!! :D</p></div>
<p>After that me discuss with them about Mozilla, Mozilla Bangladesh Community, the open web &amp; the purpose of Firefox Student Ambassadors program. There was also Keon Demonatration. Later then we arranged some snacks. That was great. All of us enjoyed a lot.</p>
<div style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5340/8988237876_3500b07236_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The awesome Mozillians!</p></div>
</div>
<div>It was a really successful event. The awesome Mozillians made me feel like we are growing fast. And give us the strength to make a dream for something big &amp; better for open web.</div>

<p>It was just another Firefox OS event in Dhaka. And the very first event for Firefox OS developer preview Keon demonstration.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was a beautiful Thursday. For the Mozilla Booth placement me &amp; Ashickur Rahman, ReMo, Mozilla Reps reached in the loby of Asian University of Bangladesh just at 9:30 AM. Ashickur Rahman brought the 19″ LCD borrowed from the our favourite Mahay Alam Khan. It was a way too secured place. No one except a valid ID card holder can’t access this place. So we was unable to inform or invite anyone <img alt=":-(" src="http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif?m=1129645325g" /></p>
<p>The plan was place a beautiful Mozilla Booth that looks awesome! Already I got the Mozilla table cloth, a horizontal &amp; a vertical banner. So we started the decoration with the banner I got.</p>
<p><a href="http://rahidhasan.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/dsc01224-resized.jpg"><img title="DSC01224.resized" alt="" src="http://rahidhasan.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/dsc01224-resized.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225" width="300" height="225" /></a><span id="more-4"></span></p>
<p>And we encountered by a beautiful crowd. That we never imagined <img alt=":-)" src="http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?m=1129645325g" /> . Just we finished the students of Asian University of Bangladesh made a great wall of people in our Mozilla Booth.</p>
<p><a href="http://rahidhasan.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/dsc01169-resized.jpg"><img title="DSC01169.resized" alt="" src="http://rahidhasan.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/dsc01169-resized.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225" width="300" height="225" /></a>  <a href="http://rahidhasan.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/dsc01150-resized.jpg"><img title="DSC01150.resized" alt="" src="http://rahidhasan.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/dsc01150-resized.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Me &amp; Ashickur Rahman faced a versatile level of interest. All of them know about Mozilla. But only about Mozilla Firefox. But we let them know its just beyond a beautiful browser. It has a vast number of project for the people. We mainly focused on Mozilla WebFWD, Webmaker &amp; Popcorn. And also let them know how they can contribute to Mozilla &amp; its browser. We encouraged a them to contribute in localization &amp; attached with Mozilla Bangladesh Community. We show them the different websites of Mozilla projects &amp; introduce them. The crowed was amazed to know the beauty of Mozilla. We show them simple way to get connected with the Mozilla Community Bangladesh.</p>
<p><a href="http://rahidhasan.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/dsc01153-resized.jpg"><img title="DSC01153.resized" alt="" src="http://rahidhasan.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/dsc01153-resized.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225" width="300" height="225" /></a>  <a href="http://rahidhasan.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/dsc01155-resized.jpg"><img title="DSC01155.resized" alt="" src="http://rahidhasan.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/dsc01155-resized.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>The most important things I would like to tell that w made a awesome survey there all the day. It was great. Students of the Asian University of Bangladesh was interested to fill up the survey. But before fill up we maintain some rules. All most all of them never knew about Mozilla projects &amp; Mozilla Community. So first of all we introduced them what is Mozilla? How it works? What it believes? What are there projects? What is Mozilla Bangladesh Community?</p>
<p><a href="http://rahidhasan.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/dsc01165-resized.jpg"><img title="DSC01165.resized" alt="" src="http://rahidhasan.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/dsc01165-resized.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>We used 3 to 10 minutes to a single survey. So it takes time :-/ . But output was great!! They was happy &amp; excited. We found a total 55 person’s data. I’ll post another post only about this survey.</p>
<p>To make our work faster we 3 laptops &amp; one 19″ LCD. One was used only for presenting all amazing Mozilla videos with the LCD. Two more we used to take survey &amp; let them about all the greatest things of Mozilla.</p>
<p><a href="http://rahidhasan.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/dsc01203-resized.jpg"><img title="DSC01203.resized" alt="" src="http://rahidhasan.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/dsc01203-resized.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225" width="300" height="225" /></a>  <a href="http://rahidhasan.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/dsc01204-resized.jpg"><img title="DSC01204.resized" alt="" src="http://rahidhasan.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/dsc01204-resized.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>And of course we distribute Mozilla awesome swags with them. The was happy to get the stickers, wrist band &amp; Mozilla Firefox button. <img alt=":-)" src="http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?m=1129645325g" /></p>
<p><a href="http://rahidhasan.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/dsc01163-resized.jpg"><img title="DSC01163.resized" alt="" src="http://rahidhasan.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/dsc01163-resized.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225" width="300" height="225" /></a>  <a href="http://rahidhasan.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/dsc01209-resized1.jpg"><img title="DSC01209.resized" alt="" src="http://rahidhasan.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/dsc01209-resized1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>At the end of the day we was tired but it was a great fun experience. The whole day we did lots of fun with the crowd. The as nothing like working with the people. Nothing like the working as a volunteer. Nothing like working for Mozilla Community.</p>
<p>It was way too awesome……… <img alt=":-)" src="http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?m=1129645325g" /> Mozillians RockZ \m/</p>
<p>By the way It was a tight security all of the place around me. We made fun with them. Here is a photo <img alt=":P" src="http://s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif?m=1129645325g" /></p>
