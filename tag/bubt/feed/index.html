<p>As part of our initiate for Firefox OS we have arranged Firefox OS App Train Day at Bangladesh University of Business &#038; Technology. It was May 2, 2014. The initiate was started on early March by Himel &#038; Ashickur Rahman to arrange some MozEvents in BUBT. Later I got involved &#038; found its a perfect campus for a AppTrain event. That time their was NO Firefox club in that University. But soon they got interested &#038; formed BUBT Firefox Club by Shahriar, Shipu Ahmed &#038; some other folks. Later they applied for arrange a day long AppTrain session in the campus. It got approved soon. And get started to make it happen.<br />
