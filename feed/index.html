				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Flame is a newly introduced awesome device powered by Firefox OS. Unfortunately unlike GeeksPhone it has no ROM download site. But don&#8217;t worry its not tough to update your Flame. You need a Linux or Mac OSX for this. First visit this link <a href="ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/b2g/nightly/latest-mozilla-central-flame/" target="_blank">ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/b2g/nightly/latest-mozilla-central-flame/</a>. Download Gaia.zip &#038; b2g-XX.0a1.en-US.android-arm.tar.gz . Extracting both file will give you two folder &#8216;gaia&#8217; &#038; &#8216;b2g&#8217;. Now you just need a executable binary to flash your phone to a latest FxOS version. You can download it from <a href="https://copy.com/L8jwK1gozfrd" title="here" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_92" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IMG_0652.jpg"><img src="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IMG_0652.jpg" alt="Flame with FxOS 2.1" width="800" height="800" class="size-full wp-image-92" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Flame with FxOS 2.1</p></div>
<p>Now connect your device with your computer. Open the Terminal &#038; run<br />
<code>adb devices</code></p>
<p>It should output like:<br />
<code><br />
Rahids-MacBook-Air:~ rahid$ adb devices<br />
List of devices attached<br />
3734ce74	device<br />
</code></p>
<p>If it returns like &#8216;adb: command not found&#8217; then you have to configure adb in your system. Check <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Debugging/Installing_ADB" title="here" target="_blank">here</a> to configure adb.</p>
<p>If it returns no devices then make sure your device is connected &#038; remote debugging is enabled in your device.</p>
<p>Now keep both &#8216;gaia&#8217;, &#8216;b2g&#8217; &#038; exceutable file &#8216;flash_Gg.sh&#8217; in same directory. Access to that directory through terminal &#038; run</p>
<p><code>./flash_Gg.sh</code></p>
<p>It should works like a champ &#038; your Flame should be updated to the latest FxOS version.</p>
<p>Special thanks to Guillermo Movia!</p>
<p>Enjoy :D</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>What was the greatest moment of Mozilla Bangladesh?</strong> If you ask this question before 22nd February I must be puzzled! Their was a few great things we passed in last few years. Especially the Mozilla Summit was too awesome. Also the last year was full of some great events. Its quite tough to find the best moment. But now if you ask me the same question I have no doubt to select that. Yesterday on February 22nd we arranged the very first meetup of our newly formed community task forces. This is the best thing ever happened for our awesome community.</p>
<div id="attachment_62" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1.jpg"><img src="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1.jpg" alt="Mozilla Bangladesh Task Force Group Photo" width="800" height="534" class="size-full wp-image-62" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mozilla Bangladesh Task Force Group Photo</p></div>
<p><span id="more-56"></span></p>
<p>So what was that actually? Not too far from today, one year earlier our community was quite small with limited number of contributors. But within these time we have had a boost of 10x!! Which was quite unexpected. The main reason of that boost is FSA program &amp; Chittagong tour in the mid of last year. To make our community more awesome &amp; dedicated in the end of last year we planned to initiate some community task forces. Which was introduced last month. The details of the task force can be found <a href="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/introducing-task-force-of-mozilla-bangladesh" title="Introducing Mozilla Bangladesh Task Force" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>After the task force formed our community lead Mahay Alam Khan take the initiative to meet all task force members for discussion &amp; plan for 2014. He did a tremendous job to make this happen just within few weeks. Kudos to him &amp; also Ashickur Rahman to make it possible.</p>
<div id="attachment_64" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/3.jpg"><img src="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/3.jpg" alt="Mozilla Bangladesh Task Force Meetup" width="800" height="600" class="size-full wp-image-64" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mozilla Bangladesh Task Force Meetup</p></div>
<p>The meetup taken place in the conference room of Hotel 71 Dhaka. All the Task Force leads, peers &amp; members was invited. Also we invited 8 more mozillians to join us. For exam &amp; other reasons 3 task force members &amp; 1 mozilian was unable to join us. All the task force leads &amp; Reps (Mahay Alam Khan, Mashkawat Ahsan, Belayet Hossain, Ashickur Rahman, Shafiul Azam, Aniruddha Adhikay, Ratul Minhaz, Tanha Islam &amp; Rahid Hasan) was attended. Some folks came to Dhaka after traveling the whole night.</p>
<p>Mahay Alam Khan welcome everybody to join this meetup. Everybody introduced them with their unique gesture. Following that Mahay Alam Khan lead the session “Overview 2014 and Goals from Mozilla”. He recently attended Mozilla San Fransisco work week in January. Aniruddha Adhikary &amp; other folks actively discussed &amp; shared their views regarding this. Just after that each task force started their SWOT analysis. The SWOT analysis of Marketing lead by Mashkawat Ahsan was really eye catchy. Maliha Mamtaz assisted to put all inputs from different task force in a single <a href="https://bangladesh.etherpad.mozilla.org/94" title="SWOT Analysis | Mozilla Bangladesh Task Force Meetup" target="_blank">etherpad</a>. Next we started discussion on these SWOT analysis of different task forces. This session was moderated by Rahid Hasan. A member from each task force presented their SWOT analysis and we shared our views &amp; discussed on it. The SWOT of Community Engagement task force was most important. The most discussed item was “Lone wolf in the community”. It was taken most of the time of the whole session. Recently we have faced some discrete &amp; meaningless activities in different areas. Which harmed our community cohesion. These kind of activities was discussed with highest priority.</p>
<div id="attachment_63" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.jpg"><img src="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.jpg" alt="SWOT Analysis" width="800" height="534" class="size-full wp-image-63" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">SWOT Analysis</p></div>
<p>After SWOT discussion we have joined in the lunch. That was too good. Ashickur Rahman, Belayet Hosssain, Maliha Momtaz &amp; some other folks took the lead &amp; show us how to eat! Following the lunch we did some group photos on the venue roof top.</p>
<p>The second half was started with presentation “Million Mozillians” by Mahay Alam Khan. It was a pretty interactive session. He discussed what is mozillian &amp; why we need millions of mozillians. Following this we started to build the event calendar for 2014. Mahay Alam Khan was the lead of this session. The draft sketch can be found <a href="https://bangladesh.etherpad.mozilla.org/96" title="Draft Event Proposal Mozilla Bangladesh 2014" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>We had a small experience sharing session at last. This session was mainly for those whose are new or low profiled but did some great things from their places. Forhad, Istiaque, Rabby, Fahia &amp; Sumi expressed their views, success stories &amp; experience with us.</p>
<div id="attachment_65" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/4.jpg"><img src="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/4.jpg" alt="Mozilla Bangladesh Reps" width="800" height="296" class="size-full wp-image-65" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mozilla Bangladesh Reps</p></div>
<p>Meetup was ended up with yet another photo session with different task forces &amp; all Mozilla Bangladesh Reps.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mozilla Bangladesh working as an active community in Bangladesh for last few years. It was started with limited number of peoples &amp; with their hard works. Day by day it passed a quite great journey. In these times we arranged lots of events. Lots of people started contributing &amp; become Mozillians. These journey was never quite smooth though but when we look back we feel it was quite amazing! Now we have 3100+ Facebook group members, 1500+ Facebook page followers &amp; 1700+ Twitter followers. Believe it or not we have had a 10x boost from last year! Its quite impressive, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Apart from this Mozilla re-branded Student Reps to Firefox Student Ambassadors on April 2013. It helped us to get more contributors around the region. Now most of the campus has FSA presence. And a significant number of Firefox Clubs formed. We got hundreds of FSA in the region. May be they all are not active, but I believe most of them are or at least trying to do something. They all fighting for the better web. How amazing that can be?<br />
<span id="more-49"></span><br />
With the giant boost of the community we faced some problem to keep it organized. And it become too hard to keep track their activities. As most of the active contributors are city based, so decentralization of the community is getting barred. And sometimes it was observed that a few contributors are trying to be lone wolf. Its also hampered the community coherence. So we started planning how this booming community can be more active, organized &amp; united. At the end of the November 2013 I started an thread “<a href="http://goo.gl/wfzF51">Empowering Community with Effective Mechanism</a>” in our community mailing list. We discussed for how we can formed some contribution area specific task force. The basic idea of the task force was simple. We have active contributors for most of the contribution area. These contributors will be lead by the task forces. The task force create &amp; manage a set of contributors with their individual interest &amp; capabilities. We believe this is a good step to manage the community with the speed of the recent community boost. Each task force will have a &#8216;Lead&#8217;. And a limited number of &#8216;Peer&#8217;. All other active &amp; passionate contributors identified by the task force will be &#8216;Member&#8217; of that task force. Important thing is the purpose is not to identify the contributors but guide the contributors &amp; create more.</p>
<p>In the mid of December we asked the <a href="https://bangladesh.etherpad.mozilla.org/proposal-taskforce-members">self nomination</a> for Lead &amp; Peer for 8 task forces: 1. Community Engagement, 2. WebDev, 3. L10n, 4. Marketing, 5. Apps Development, 6. Webmaker, 7. Student Ambassadors &amp; 8. Pr &amp; Communication. The Community IT &amp; WoMoz task force will be launched later as there was not enough contributors. The response was great, more than expected. We got 28 contributors interested to be a Lead/Peer of a task force. All of them disclosed their ideas &amp; views by answering 4 questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Please briefly describe your experience with Mozilla Bangladesh (or any other open source / IT community).</li>
<li>Why you think you are a leader of this community?</li>
<li>What will be your goal for this task force?</li>
<li>Where do you want to see Mozilla Bangladesh in 2014?</li>
</ol>
<p>After the deadline of nomination a team of volunteers (Mahay Alam Khan, Ashickur Rahman, Shafiul Azam Chowdhury &amp; Rahid Hasan) started analyzing the inputs. Based on the inputs in the <a href="https://bangladesh.etherpad.mozilla.org/proposal-taskforce-members">nomination pad</a>, previous records, past contribution, working area &amp; able to manage time this team of volunteer proposed the task force Lead/Peer. In the beginning of January 2014 the proposal was submitted to a set of most active community members &amp; leaders of MozBD for final discussion &amp; selection. After all of this steps &amp; discussions we are now able to conclude the task force selection.</p>
<p>Each task force will be consist of Lead, Peer(s) &amp; Members. We are just announcing the Lead &amp; Peer(s) of the task forces. Members will be added by the individual task force based on the interest, passion &amp; necessity. And it should be informed to all other task forces &amp; larger community. A task force member can become a Peer (if needed) after the discussion with all other task force Lead &amp; Peer with appropriate reasons. Each task force will be expired &amp; reformed in each six months. As it is the first time &amp; quite experimental, the first task force will be expired in December 2014.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Firefox changed a lot in recent years. But the upcoming UX design of the Firefox is really cool! They calling it Australis. Its really really beautiful &amp; simplified. And it just landed in Nightly on Firefox 28. So you can check it right away. Download it from <a href="http://nightly.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<div style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="New Design of Firefox in Mac" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3730/10939467465_f0332f30df_b.jpg" width="1024" height="755" /><p class="wp-caption-text">New Design of Firefox in Mac</p></div>
<p>So what is the Australis?<span id="more-28"></span></p>
<p>Well from my user experience view I found its a beautifully designed modern, clean &amp; comfortable web browsing experience. Especially the tabs looks pretty elegant. And I just love the pinned tabs! I found some of my early used add-ons icons added just beside the search bar just after the first launch. Its easy to access from there. I had to find it differently in previous version.</p>
<div style="width: 1660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~shorlander/blog-images/australis-landing-on-nightly/intro-image-large.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Australis in three different platform. Firefox on Linux, Mac, and Windows" src="http://people.mozilla.org/~shorlander/blog-images/australis-landing-on-nightly/intro-image-large.jpg" width="1650" height="1050" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Australis in three different platform. Firefox on Linux, Mac, and Windows</p></div>
<p>There is a few changes in bookmark button. Its now paired with the bookmark list button. Now its more easy access to bookmarks. The download progress bar is more generous now.</p>
<p>Customization of Firefox is really fun. Its more easy &amp; simplified. It can be found in the new menu button added in the beside the search bar &amp; all add-ons icons. Its looks cool &amp; useful :-)</p>
<p>One more thing I found interesting, its added scroll bounce effect like other browsers in the Mac system. Finally!</p>
<p>The details information of all changes can be found in <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/ux/2013/11/australis-is-landing-in-firefox-nightly/">Mozilla UX blog</a>.</p>

<p>In the last year Mozilla Bangladesh first time arranged <a href="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/moziftar-mozilla-bangladesh-iftar-party-2012/" target="_blank">MozIftar in Dhaka</a>. It was an interesting event. Iftar basically an Islamic term. In the holy month of Ramadan muslim people fasting the whole day &amp; take meal at the dawn. It is called Iftar. We mozillians from Bangladesh do that thing together with Mozilla mission. And named it MozIftar. From last year we are regularly arranging MozIftar in Bangladesh. This event taken place in Star Kabab (Old Dhaka) on July 29, 2013.</p>
<p>We had some agendas for this meetup:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set a plan &amp; direction for Mozilla Bangladesh for next one year.</li>
<li>Build a event calendar.</li>
<li>If possible create some program specific task force.</li>
<li>Discuss about event plan (cost &#8211; benefit &amp; event target).</li>
<li>We have some issues to discuss face to face.</li>
<li>And ofcourse Iftar :-)</li>
</ul>
<div style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="MozIftar Dhaka 2013 Banner" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3712/9638279738_3702b91b5e.jpg" width="500" height="281" /><p class="wp-caption-text">MozIftar Dhaka 2013 Banner</p></div>
<p><span id="more-42"></span>We opened a sign-up form for this event. We found around 70 people signed up for the event. We expected there will be around 50 people in the event. But beyond all expectation we found 70+!! We never thought it can be happen. In the last year MozIftar Dhaka attended by only 10/12 Mozillians. Surely we reached a great momentum since then. Most Importantly this year we had arranged another <a href="http://blog.rahidhasan.com/moziftar-chittagong-2013/" target="_blank">MozIftar in Chittagong</a>. It was attended by around 40 Mozillians.</p>
<div style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="MozIftar Dhaka 2013" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7394/9638284400_24d99283f0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" /><p class="wp-caption-text">MozIftar Dhaka 2013</p></div>
<p>In the event our senior Mozillian Mahay Alam Khan started the discussion. He emphasized on using mailing list for formal discussion. We discussed about our future goal of Mozilla Bangladesh, the upcoming Mozilla Summit 2013, future event plan &amp; most importantly we decided to propose to set Cox&#8217;s Bazar as a venue of South Asian Meet-up in 2014.</p>
<div style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="MozIftar Dhaka 2013 Group Photo" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7409/10979091765_a13e0c723c.jpg" width="500" height="375" /><p class="wp-caption-text">MozIftar Dhaka 2013 Group Photo</p></div>
<p>We also found a lot new enthusiast who&#8217;s are interested to contribute in Mozilla. They was pretty curious about the activity of Mozilla Bangladesh. And I found some really interested people from BRAC University. They are interested for a FxOS event in their campus. We had a successful discussion about that.</p>
<p>It was the last event for the MozIftar Bangladesh 2013. We had plan for another MozIftar this year in Cox&#8217;s Bazar. But for some unavoidable reason we had to drop Cox&#8217;s Bazar as a venue of MozIftar Bangladesh 2013.</p>

<p>Since the last year we Mozilla Bangladesh start an interesting event idea. MozIftar! Iftar is a religious term for muslim peoples. In the holy month of Ramadan muslims fasting the whole day till the dawn. At the evening they take their meal. Its called Iftar. Now in muslim world Iftar Party is very much popular. Here we do the same thing with Mozilla mission. Its much like a meetup with Islamic ethics.</p>
<div style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="MozIftar Chittagong 2013" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7323/9638043014_c815525f84_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" /><p class="wp-caption-text">MozIftar Chittagong 2013</p></div>
<p><span id="more-37"></span>Last year we did the MozIftar in Dhaka only. But this year we have broaden our capability to Chittagong also. The MozIftar Chittagong arranged on July 12, 2013. It was taken place in MFC, Chittagong. Around forty people joined the event.</p>
<p>It was basically a meet-up with Chittagong Mozillians. We discussed about different plans &amp; upcoming event ideas. Their was proposal for Firefox OS App Training Day in International Islamic University &amp; East Delta University. Also we discussed about future of Mozilla Chittagong Community &amp; how we can relate with different Mozilla programs.</p>
<div style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="Mozillians waiting for Iftar time" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5471/9638032746_6b8596099e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Mozillians waiting for Iftar time</p></div>
<p>As already told their was about 40 Mozillians attended. I can remember only few names. Among them Towfique Anam Rine worked really hard to make it happen. Also their was Shamsuzzaman Sadi, Rakib, Asif, Iftekhar, Rashed, Arnob, Rafa &amp; more others Mozillians cooperated &amp; attended the event. Robin Mehedee &amp; me traveled from Dhaka to join this event.</p>
<div style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="Dinner!" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7439/9634799997_cab1be1d84_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Dinner!</p></div>
<p>Thanks to all awesome Chittagong Mozillian to make another successful event.</p>

<p>Firefox Student Ambassadors program just launched recently. With less than a month we successfully organized an event. The very first Student Ambassador event. It was a meetup of Firefox Student Ambassadors &amp; Mozillians of Mozilla Bangladesh Community.<span id="more-14"></span></p>
<div style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="Team AUB Firefox Club" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3675/8988291308_d5a545e015_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Team AUB Firefox Club</p></div>
<p>This event organized by AUB Firefox Club with the support of Mozilla Bangladesh. The club lead Zobayer Ahmed Khan take the initiative &amp; play a really crucial role to make it happen.</p>
<p>The background of this event is very interesting. On June 2, 2013 in a FB chat Zobayer asked me to meet with the club members of AUB Firefox Club and give them some direction. I asked him why not do something big &amp; more open? I proposed him to organize a Meetup event for all Firefox Student Ambassadors in Dhaka. He take that challenge &amp; make it happen to oraganize the first Firefox Student Ambassadors Meetup in just 4 days! This is really awesome \m/ . Feels like a Mozillians!!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8123/8988262540_711788a7e1_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p>Primarily we estimate a rough plan of the event. As he is not a Rep, I created the event on Reps portal &amp; asked for the budget. Before that I discuss with my mentor Vineel. He gave me a very positive response. And just the day before the event Soumya Deb gave me the green signal on behalf of the Reps Council that the budget is approved.</p>
<p>My estimation was there will be 25 to 30 attendee. Among them 15 to 20 Student Ambassadors, 5 to 10 Mozillians, 5 to 7 WoMoz &amp; atleast 2 Mozilla Reps will join in this event. But there was also a little bit bad weather on event day. That can hamper those figures. And I&#8217;m shocked to see the awesomeness of Mozillians participation!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Open discussion session" alt="Open discussion session" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7414/8987075045_f621ae4834_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p>I found 35 attendee in the event. Among them 15 Student Ambassador, 5 WoMoz, 18 Mozillian &amp; 2 Mozilla Rep attended. Really unexpected from me. I never thought this crowd. Interestingly two WoMoz (Asma &amp; Mukta) came after about 1.5 hours of journey! What a passion!!</p>
<p>We started our event on 4:30 PM at Uttara Amontron Restaurant. Me (Rahid Hasan) started with a little introduction. I introduce the AUB Firefox Club &amp; its lead Zobayer Ahmed to the audience. Whose are the big guy of this arrangement. Later everyone introduce their name and their University/Institute. Most of the mozillians came from Dhaka Polytechnic Institute. Their was also Mozillians from North South University, American International University &#8211; Bangladesh, International University of Business Agriculture &amp; Technology. And ofcourse the organizing team from Asian University of Bangladesh.</p>
<div style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="Firefox OS Developer Preview Keon demonstration" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7377/8987095957_5d61a75f2a_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Firefox OS Developer Preview Keon demonstration</p></div>
<p>Then Ashickur Rahman (Mozilla Reps) start the interactive session. We asked them some questions. They response &amp; share their ideas. The gist of that session is here:</p>
<p>Why you joined Fx Student Ambassadors?</p>
<div id="magicdomid42">

</div>
<div id="magicdomid61">
<ul>
<li>Talk with institute authority to organize events if needed</li>
<li>logistics support like : budget, swag</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="magicdomid63">Question from mozillians</div>

<p>After that me discuss with them about Mozilla, Mozilla Bangladesh Community, the open web &amp; the purpose of Firefox Student Ambassadors program. There was also Keon Demonatration. Later then we arranged some snacks. That was great. All of us enjoyed a lot.</p>
<div style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5340/8988237876_3500b07236_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The awesome Mozillians!</p></div>
</div>
<div>It was a really successful event. The awesome Mozillians made me feel like we are growing fast. And give us the strength to make a dream for something big &amp; better for open web.</div>

<p>It was just another Firefox OS event in Dhaka. And the very first event for Firefox OS developer preview Keon demonstration. This event arranged in Bangladesh University of Engineering &amp; Technology (BUET). It was jointly organized by Mozilla Bangladesh Community &amp; BSADD group. My heartily welcome to those people to make this event possible. Especially thanks to Shafiul Azam, a ReMo based on Dhaka to take the initiative.<span id="more-12"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the event we discuss about our upcoming events &amp; future plans. The cost of the event was sponsored by three ReMo.  It was a nice event &amp; I indeed enjoyed a lot.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>And finally I got my device powered by Firefox OS. Its geeksphone Keon. Its really beautiful and handy. In first look I found Its interface is fast. Well there is some bugs ofcourse as it is a developer preview. There was a system update waiting. Hopefully most of the bugs will be fixed after update.</p>
<p>In first look I found it is unable to pair with bluetooth device.  After the update it is fixed now. I&#8217;ll write a details review later. Now for today here is the photo of its unboxing :-)</p>
